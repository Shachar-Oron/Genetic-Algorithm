# Genetic-Algorithm
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm-based text translator. Given an input encoded txt file , the program aims to decode the encrypted text and provide the translated output.

The Genetic Algorithm follows a genetic process that involves the following steps:

* *Initialization*: The algorithm starts by creating an initial population of potential solutions. Each solution represents a possible decryption key for the encrypted text.

* *Evaluation:* Each solution in the population is evaluated by calculating its fitness. In the context of text translation, fitness is typically determined by comparing the decrypted text to a known set of valid words or using language models to assess the likelihood of the decrypted text being in the target language.

* *Selection:* Solutions with higher fitness are more likely to be selected for the next generation. This process mimics the natural selection mechanism, where individuals with favorable traits have a higher chance of survival and reproduction.

* *Crossover:* The selected solutions undergo crossover or recombination, which involves combining the genetic material (decryption keys) of two parent solutions to create new offspring solutions. Crossover helps explore different combinations of decryption keys and can lead to improved solutions.

* *Mutation:* Random changes, or mutations, are applied to the offspring solutions to introduce new genetic material. Mutation adds diversity to the population and prevents the algorithm from converging to a suboptimal solution too quickly.

* *Replacement:* The offspring solutions replace some of the least fit solutions in the current population. This step ensures that the population remains diverse and allows for further exploration of the solution space.

* *Termination:* The algorithm iterates through the steps of evaluation, selection, crossover, mutation, and replacement for a certain number of generations or until a termination condition is met. Termination conditions may include reaching a maximum number of generations, finding a satisfactory solution, or exceeding a predefined computation time.

* *Output:* Once the algorithm terminates, the best solution, or the solution with the highest fitness, represents the decoded text. This solution is returned as the translated output.

## How to run:

To run the main.exe file generated from the Genetic Algorithm text translator, follow these steps:

1. Dwnload the main.exe file and place it in the same directory as the input file enc.txt and any other necessary files.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

3. Navigate to the directory where the main.exe file is located using the cd command.
4. Once you are in the correct directory, execute the main.exe file by typing its name followed by the Enter key. 
5. The program will ask you which file you want to the input file, select a file that is in the present working directory.
6. The program will ask you which type of genetic algorithm would you like, you can type 'basic', 'darwin' or 'lamark'.

## Project Structure
The project directory consists of the following files:

* main.py: The main Python script that implements the Genetic Algorithm for text translation.
* enc.txt: The input file containing the encrypted text to be translated.
* plain.txt: The output file where the decoded text will be saved.
* perm.txt: The file that contains the dictionary of the solution, mapping encrypted characters to their corresponding decoded characters.
* README.md: The documentation file that provides information about the project and instructions for usage.
Other supporting files or directories if applicable.
In the updated structure, the plain.txt file is used to store the decoded text obtained from the Genetic Algorithm translation process. This file will contain the decrypted version of the input encrypted text.

Additionally, the perm.txt file is introduced, which serves as a dictionary for the solution. It maps the encrypted characters to their corresponding decoded characters, providing insight into the decryption key generated by the Genetic Algorithm.
